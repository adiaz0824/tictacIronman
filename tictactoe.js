// ========================================================
// -We will define two variables for "Player 1" and "Player 2"
// var Player1 and var Player2
// Player1 and Player2 are empty arrays:
var Player1 = [];
var Player2 = [];

// -We will have to establish which player will go first
// by creating an onlick event where the users can choose player 1 or 2

// -Once the first Player is chosen a script will run to alternate 
// between players

// -For every time a player hovers over each game tile, that tile 
// will change colors to display that the mouse is over that tile
// thus using a "Hover" or "Mouseover" event

// -When a player clicks on a <div> tile, there will be an 
// "onclick" event that will turn the <div> into a picture or 
// an X or O corresponding to Player1 or Player2 

// -There will be another function inside the onclick event which
// will push the <div> into a Player1 and Player2 array

// -We will need to create a winning array combination based
// on the game tile <divs>

// -We will need to create a loop that checks the values or 
// Player1 and Player2's array and see if they match the winning array

// -If there is a match, then a message will appear to state either
// Player1 or Player2 has won.

// -If you click the reset button, then the game will reset
